# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains examples of three main categories of design patterns in Java:
1. **Behavioral Design Patterns**
2. **Creational Design Patterns**
3. **Structural Design Patterns**

Each folder contains Java code examples demonstrating key design patterns within that category.

---

- **Behavioral Design Patterns**: Focus on interaction and communication between objects.
  - Example: `ObserverPattern.java`, `StrategyPattern.java`
- **Creational Design Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
  - Example: `SingletonPattern.java`, `FactoryMethodPattern.java`
- **Structural Design Patterns**: Concern the composition of classes and objects.
  - Example: `AdapterPattern.java`, `CompositePattern.java`

## Naming Conventions

The following naming conventions are used for better clarity and adherence to Java standards:

- **Classes**: Class names are written in `PascalCase` (e.g., `ObserverPattern.java`).
- **Methods & Variables**: Methods and variables use `camelCase` (e.g., `getInstance`, `createFactory`).
- **Constants**: Constants are written in all uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MAX_COUNT`).

Folder names follow lowercased naming with spaces to categorize the type of design pattern.

## Requirements

To run the Java files, ensure you have the following:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or later).
2. A Java-compatible IDE or a terminal setup with the ability to compile and run `.java` files.

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/design-patterns-java.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd design-patterns-java
